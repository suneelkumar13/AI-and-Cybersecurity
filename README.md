* [Perceptron for Spam Detection](https://github.com/suneelkumar13/AI-and-Cybersecurity-Assignment_2/blob/main/AISec_Spam_Perceptron.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/suneelkumar13/AI-and-Cybersecurity-Spam_Detection_Assignment_2/blob/main/AISec_Spam_Perceptron.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is Perceptron??** A perceptron is a machine learning algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. Hyperparameters in the moel are tunned to acheive better performance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dataset Details:** The dataset used in Perceptron for Phish Detection Jupyter Notebook is extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites).

* [Linear Regression for Spam Classification](https://github.com/suneelkumar13/AI-and-Cybersecurity-Assignment_2/blob/main/AISec_Spam_Linear_Regression.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/suneelkumar13/AI-and-Cybersecurity-Spam_Detection_Assignment_2/blob/main/AISec_Spam_Linear_Regression.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is Linear Regression??** Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dataset Details:** The dataset used in Logistic Regression for Spam Classification Jupyter Notebook is a refined dataset of [SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection), extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* [SVM for Spam Detection](https://github.com/suneelkumar13/AI-and-Cybersecurity-Assignment_2/blob/main/AISec_Spam_SVM.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/suneelkumar13/AI-and-Cybersecurity-Spam_Detection_Assignment_2/blob/main/AISec_Spam_SVM.ipynb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What are SVMs??** In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. Hyperparameters in the model are tunned to achieve better performance.
