Perceptron for Phish Detection 
         What is Perceptron?? A perceptron is a machine learning algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. Hyperparameters in the moel are tunned to acheive better performance.

        
Logistic Regression for SMS Spam Classification
         What is Logistic Regression?? Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). Hyperparameters in the model are tunned to achieve better performance.

        
SVM for Phish Detection 
         What are SVMs?? In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. Hyperparameters in the model are tunned to achieve better performance.
